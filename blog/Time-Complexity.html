          <div class="post-body">
          <p>We've likely all seen and learned about the 'Big O Notation', which describes the runtime complexity of an algorithm in computer science. When analyzing an algorithm, we can discuss it's best, worst, and average time complexities. In the case of Big O Notation, we simply assume the worst case to describe time complexity. Here is a list of the most commonly used notations, in order of smaller to largest runtime.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>O(1) indicates a constant runtime. This means that the algorithm described has the same time complexity, regardless of size or any other constraints.</li>
            <li>O(log(n)) indicates a logarithmic runtime. Logarithmic runtimes are unique in that they start with a larger time-complexity, but increase slower past a certain point. This leads into the next runtime, linear runtimes</li>
            <li>O(n) indicates a linear runtime. While faster than O(log n) at first, it quickly becomes much more demanding, time complexity wise. As indicated by name, the time complexity increases linearly with the amount of calls.</li>
            <li>O(n log(n)) indicates a linear logarithmic runtime. While better than the following two time complexities, linear logarithmic (as you can imagine) is taking a product of the previous two runtimes. This can be pretty large but is still optimal in comparison to what follows this time complexitiy.</li>
            <li>O(n<sup>2</sup>) indicates a quadratic runtime. This is where the danger zone for time complexity begins, as it becomes much more demanding than a linear algorithm after only a short number of calls.</li>
            <li>O(2<sup>n</sup>) indicates a exponential runtime. You really want to avoid this unless your algorithm has <i>very</i> minimal calls to it. With each additional call, the total runtime doubles. You can imagine this gets out of hand very quickly!</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The above list includes the most common time complexities that you can run into. So what are these algorithms that they apply to? One common set of algorithms that are analyzed using Big O Notation are sorting algorithms. These algorithms can range from awful to amazing in their performance, depending on the data being sorted and it's orientation. A great way to show this range is with the sorting algorithm, insertion sort.</p>
          <br>
          <center><h4>This is a simple demonstration of insertion sort. Insertion sort takes one element at a time from a list, and inserts it at the proper position in a new "sub-list" until it has inserted every element from the original list into the sub-list.</h4>
          <img src="/static/insertsort.gif"></center>
          <br>
          <br>
          <p>Now we can imagine the different possible cases when using this algorithm. In the best case scenario, the original list is already sorted, so insertion sort will simply move each element one at a time to the end of the sub-list where it belongs, creating an O(n) time complexity. As sorting algorithms go, this is great! We only have one problem: We barely ever get a list in sorted order already and even if we did, we wouldn't need to run it through insertion sort! So our best case scenario is highly unlikely.</p>
          <p>Now picture the average case scenario: The list is <i>not</i> pre-sorted for us. That means when we select our element from the main list, we end up checking every single element in the sub-list until we find the proper position. This results in a linear call for every linear call we make, so the typical case for insertion sort is a quadratic runtime!</p>
          <h3>So <i>why</i> is all this important?</h3>
          <p>We know what these possible runtimes are and how we get them in a practical case. Answering the "what" and "how" questions leaves one more question: Why?</p>
          <p>The simple answer is that we are limited by time. Have you ever seen someone get frustrated because their webpage didn't instantly load? The same problem applies here! When we use these algorithms, they won't always be working with a list of 10 elements. In the working world, we could be working with element counts in the millions or higher!</p>
          <p>Picture this: We have a list of 100 million customer records to sort. Say we use insertion sort once, which is an exponential runtime, and another sorting algorithm mergesort, which is a linear logarithmic runtime. Assuming that "n" is 100 million, the difference in runtimes is about 3.76 * 10<sup>6</sup> in magnitude. Insertion sort would make you sit there for hours waiting, while mergesort would be done much faster. See the difference?</p>
          <p>This example embodies why using the better time complexities is so important. If you have a small list with only a few elements, (think fingers and toes), then these time complexities don't really matter. It is when you run into the realistically sized data, upwards to the billions, that using the correct algorithms can make the difference between 10 seconds and 10 years.</p>
