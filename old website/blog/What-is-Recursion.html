          <div class="post-body">
            <p>The other day a friend of mine who is very new to programming asked me,"what is recursion?" Now I could go into various depths of discussion just on what recursion is, the various different types of recursion I've learned and experienced, where it's strengths lie against other divide-and-conquer algorithms and such. </p>
            <center><img src="/static/divide-conquer" alt=""></center>
            <br>
            <p>There is a different way to teach recursion, but first a preface to show my reasoning.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Part of the reason I've grown to enjoy programming so much is because I'm a visual learner; I love to see and do all these techniques I've learned in class. In contrast, when I took chemistry my first term I always found the class boring and and somewhat challenging, because so much of it was stuff that I'd just read about and memorize. Sometimes it felt like I was just memorizing the script to a play, it was missing that "experiencing" element I enjoy so much. It was no surprise that course gave me more trouble than my computer science coursework that term, because of the more "tactile" learning process that I engaged in with computer science.</p>
            <br>
            <p>So what am I trying to get at with my explanation? That oftentimes, the best way to learn a new concept is through real experience. This isn't to take away from learning by listening and observing, like you would in most academic lecture settings, (seriously, don't skip lectures!) Just think about what you do once you've taken your notes from listening at your last mathematics lecture: You practice! Most people don't have a brain that works like RAM, so come exam time you're crunching as many practice problems as possible. The same concept applies to what I'm saying!</p>

            <br>
            <p>So without further delay, 
            <a href="/blog/What-is-Recursion">here is what I believe to be a perfect example of recursion!</a></p>
            <br>
            <p>If you're reading this, you now have a much better understanding of recursion!</p></center>
